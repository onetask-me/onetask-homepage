			<li>
				b. Automatic Billing and Policies. When you purchase a Subscription, you
				expressly acknowledge and agree that: (i) OneTask and/or its third-party
				payment processors are authorized to charge you, at the beginning of

				adjustment in accordance with the terms and conditions of these Terms,
				for as long as your Subscription continues; and (ii) your Subscription
				is continuous until the earlier of (A) your cancellation of such
				Subscription (including any notice period specified in Section 6.3(c) of
				these Terms) and (B) the suspension, discontinuation, or termination of
				your access to such Subscription or to the Service in accordance with
				these Terms. You acknowledge and agree that the amount billed may vary
				due to proOneTaskal offers, changes in the Subscription Fees in

				applicable taxes, and you authorize us to charge your payment method for
				the changed amounts.

				have access to the Subscription through the end of the current
				Subscription Term.
			</li>

			<li>
				d. Cancellations; Refunds. You may cancel your User Account or any
				Subscription at your sole discretion. Purchases are non-refundable;
				OneTask is not obligated to refund any payments, but may do so at its
				sole discretion. SUBJECT TO THE FOREGOING SENTENCE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND
				AGREE THAT, IN THE EVENT THAT: (i) OneTask SUSPENDS OR TERMINATES YOUR
				SUBSCRIPTION, YOUR USER ACCOUNT, OR THESE TERMS, OR (ii) YOU CANCEL YOUR
				SUBSCRIPTION, YOU WILL RECEIVE NO REFUND FOR SUCH SUSPENSION,
				TERMINATION, OR CANCELLATION, NOR FOR ANY UNUSED TIME ON YOUR

			In connection with payments of Subscription Fees and/or any other monetary

			customary billing information such as name, billing address, and credit
			card information to us or to the applicable third-party payment processor.
			All information that you provide in connection with a monetary transaction
			interaction with the Service must be accurate, complete, and current. You
			agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your payment method used in
			connection with a monetary transaction interaction with the Service at the
			prices in effect when such charges are incurred. You hereby authorize the
			collection of such amounts by charging your designated payment method or
			credit or debit card, either directly by us, or indirectly via a
			third-party payment processor. We cannot control any fees that may be
			charged to you by your bank in connection with the collection of
			Subscription Fees or any other fees, and we disclaim any and all liability
			in this regard. If you are directed to a third-party payment processor,
			you will be subject to terms and conditions governing the use of that
			third party’s service and to that third party’s personal information
			collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy
			notice before using such third party’s services. Without limiting the

			You acknowledge and understand that third-party payment processors may
			collect and retain Third-Party Fees whenever you pay Subscription Fees.
			Except as otherwise provided herein, Subscription Fees are non-refundable.
			If you believe you have been improperly charged and would like to request
			a refund, please contact us at support@onetask.me. You will pay all
			applicable taxes, if any, relating to any monetary transaction interaction
			with the Service.
		</p>

		<h5 className='mt-8 text-left font-semibold'>6.5 Free Trials</h5>

		<p>
			We may, at our sole discretion, offer free trials for a specific part of

			for a free trial, we will automatically charge your payment method on the
			first day of your initial Subscription Term after the trial period ends,
			and on each subsequent billing date, as per the terms stated here. To
			avoid charges to your payment method, you must cancel your free trial by
			11:59pm Pacific Time on the final day of the trial period. If you cancel
			your free trial, the cancellation may take effect immediately. You
			understand and agree that any offers provided through the Service,
			including Subscription offers, are subject to change at our discretion and
			may be updated at any time. If at any point, OneTask believes you are
			abusing the applications, OneTask at its sole discretion may revoke your
			free trail.

			9. Third-Party Links and Information

		<p>
			The Service may contain links to third-party materials that are not owned

			products, or services. If you access a third-party website or service from
			the Service or share your User Content on or through any third-party
			website or service, you do so at your own risk, and you understand that
			these Terms and OneTask’s Privacy Notice do not apply to your use of such
			sites. You expressly relieve OneTask from any and all liability arising
			from your (including any Authorized Users’) access to or use of any
			third-party website, service, or content, including, without limitation,
			User Content submitted by other Users. Additionally, your dealings with or
			participation in proOneTasks of advertisers found on the Service,
			including payment and delivery of goods, and any other terms (such as
			warranties) are solely between you and such advertisers. You agree that
			OneTask will not be responsible for any loss or damage of any sort

		</p>

		<h4 className='mt-8 text-left font-semibold'>10. Release and Indemnity</h4>

		<p>
			You hereby release, on behalf of yourself and any Authorized Users,

			OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE
			RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS
			OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE RELEASED PARTY.”
		</p>

		<p>
			You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless OneTask and its
			affiliates, and its and their respective licensors, employees,
			contractors, agents, officers, and directors, from and against any and all
			claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, debts, and
			expenses (including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees) arising from:
			(a) your access to and use of the Service, including any data or content
			transmitted or received by you; (b) your violation of any term of these
			Terms, including, without limitation, your breach of any of the
			representations and warranties herein contained; (c) your violation of any

		<h4 className='mt-8 text-left font-semibold'>11. No Warranty</h4>

		<p>
			The Service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Use of the
			Service is at your own risk. To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable
			Law, the Service, the OneTask Content, and any other information available
			on or through the Service are provided without warranties of any kind,
			whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied
			warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
			non-infringement. No advice or information, whether oral or written,
			obtained by you from OneTask or through the Service will create any
			warranty not expressly stated herein. Without limiting the generality of
			the foregoing, OneTask and its affiliates, and its and their respective
			licensors, do not warrant that the OneTask Content or any other
			information contained in the Service are accurate, comprehensive,
			reliable, useful, or correct; that the Service will meet your (or any
			Authorized User’s) requirements; that the Service will be available at any
			particular time or location, uninterrupted, or secure; that any defects or
			errors in the Service will be corrected; or that the Service is free of
			viruses or other harmful components. Any content downloaded or otherwise
			obtained through the use of the Service is downloaded at your own risk,
			and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your (including the

		</p>

		<p>
			Further, OneTask does not warrant, endorse, guarantee, recommend, or
			assume responsibility for any product or service advertised or offered by
			any third party through the Service or any hyperlinked website or service,
			and OneTask will not be a party to, or in any way monitor, any transaction
			between you and third-party providers of products or services.
		</p>

		<p>
			Federal law and some states, provinces, and other jurisdictions do not
			allow the exclusion and limitations of certain implied warranties, so the
			above exclusions may not apply to you. These Terms give you specific legal
			rights, and you may also have other rights, which vary from jurisdiction
			to jurisdiction. The disclaimers and exclusions under these Terms will not
			apply to the extent prohibited by Applicable Law.

		<h4 className='mt-8 text-left font-semibold'>
			12. Limitation of Liability
		</h4>

		<p>
			To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, in no event will
			OneTask or its affiliates, or its or their respective licensors,
			employees, contractors, agents, officers, or directors, be liable for any
			indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary
			damages, including, without limitation, damages for loss of profits,
			goodwill, use, or data, or other intangible losses, arising out of or
			relating to the use of, or inability to use, the Service, and/or to the

			no circumstances will OneTask be responsible for any damage, loss, or
			injury resulting from hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access to
			or use of the Service or your User Account or the information contained
			therein.
		</p>

		<p>
			To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, OneTask assumes no
			liability or responsibility for any (a) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies
			of content; (b) personal injury or property damage, of any nature
			whatsoever, resulting from your (or any Authorized User’s) access to or
			use of the Service; (c) any unauthorized access to or use of the servers
			running the Service and/or any and all personal information stored

			otherwise made available through the Service; and/or (g) User Content or
			the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party. In no

			liable to you for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations,
			damages, losses, or costs in an amount exceeding the amount you paid to
			OneTask hereunder or $50.00, whichever is greater.
		</p>

		<p>
			This limitation of liability section applies whether the alleged liability
			is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other
			basis, even if OneTask has been advised of the possibility of such damage.
		</p>

		<p>
			Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental
			or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not
			apply to you. These Terms give you specific legal rights, and you may also
			have other rights, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The
			disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under these Terms
			will not apply to the extent prohibited by Applicable Law.

			13. Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver
		</h4>

		<h5 className='mt-8 text-left font-semibold'>13.1 Governing Law</h5>

		<p>
			You agree that: (a) the Service will be deemed solely based in Delaware;
			and (b) the Service will be deemed a passive one that does not give rise
			to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in
			jurisdictions other than Delaware. These Terms will be governed by the
			internal substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without respect to its
			conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that these Terms
			evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the
			preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law governing these
			Terms, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (“FAA”) governs the
			interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement below and
			preempts all state laws (and laws of other jurisdictions) to the fullest
			extent permitted by Applicable Law. If the FAA is found to not apply to
			any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then
			that issue will be resolved under and governed by the law of the U.S.
			state where you live (if applicable) or the jurisdiction mutually agreed
			upon in writing by you and us. The application of the United Nations
			Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
			excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of
			the federal and state courts located in Delaware for any actions for which
			we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a
			court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened
			infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our Intellectual Property
			Rights or other proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration
			Agreement below, including any provisional relief required to prevent
			irreparable harm. You agree that Delaware is the proper and exclusive
			forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court
			proceedings in the event that the Arbitration Agreement below is found to
			be unenforceable.
		</p>

		<h5 className='mt-8 text-left font-semibold'>13.2 Arbitration</h5>

		<p>
			READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE
			THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM
			OneTask. This Arbitration Agreement applies to and governs any dispute,
			controversy, or claim between you and OneTask that arises out of or
			relates to, directly or indirectly: (a) these Terms, including the
			formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation,
			validity, or enforceability thereof; (b) access to or use of the Service,
			including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (c) any
			transactions through, by, or using the Service; or (d) any other aspect of
			your relationship or transactions with OneTask, directly or indirectly, as
			a consumer (each, a “Claim,” and, collectively, “Claims”). This
			Arbitration Agreement will apply, without limitation, to all Claims that
			arose or were asserted before or after your agreement to these Terms.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you are a new User, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration
			Agreement within thirty (30) days of accepting these Terms by emailing
			OneTask at legal@onetask.me with your full, legal name and stating your
			intent to opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement. Note that opting out of
			this Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of these Terms,
			including the provisions regarding controlling law or the courts in which
			any disputes must be brought.
		</p>

		<p>
			For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at legal@onetask.me and to
			attempt to resolve the Claim with us informally. In the unlikely event
			that we have not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we
			each agree to resolve such Claim exclusively through binding arbitration
			by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) before a single arbitrator
			(the “Arbitrator”), under the Expedited Procedures then in effect for AAA
			(the “Rules”), except as provided herein. In the event of any conflict
			between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration
			Agreement will control. AAA may be contacted at www.adr.org, where the
			Rules are also available. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S.
			county where you live (if applicable) or Sussex County, Delaware, unless
			you and OneTask agree otherwise. You acknowledge and understand that,
			depending on the kind of User you are, either (i) each of you and us will
			be responsible for paying any AAA filing and administrative and Arbitrator
			fees in accordance with the Rules, and the award rendered by the
			Arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees,
			and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, or (ii) AAA may
			require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply
			for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from AAA; the award rendered by
			the Arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable
			attorneys’ fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses;
			and you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without
			first engaging in arbitration, but this would not absolve you of your
			commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any
			judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any
			court of competent jurisdiction. You and OneTask agree that the
			Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will
			have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the scope,
			interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this
			Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this
			Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator will also be
			responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including
			issues relating to whether these Terms are, or any provision of these
			Terms is, unconscionable or illusory, and any defense to arbitration,
			including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, and/or estoppel.
		</p>

		<p>
			Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed as: preventing
			OneTask from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts
			as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
			misappropriation, or violation of its data security, Intellectual Property
			Rights, or other proprietary rights; or preventing you from asserting
			claims in small claims court, provided that your claims qualify, and so
			long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an
			individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.{' '}
		</p>

		<p>
			If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or
			unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful
			provision, in whole or in part, will be severed. Severance of the void,
			unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will have no
			impact on the remaining provisions of this Arbitration Agreement, which
			will remain in force, or on the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of
			any remaining Claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Arbitration
			Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial
			Waiver below is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or
			in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive
			relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and
			only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in
			a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief
			subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement will be arbitrated
			under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute
			regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief will be stayed
			pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.
		</p>

		<h5 className='mt-8 text-left font-semibold'>
			13.3 Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver
		</h5>

		<p>
			REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF USER YOU ARE, INCLUDING WHETHER YOU ARE A
			NATURAL PERSON OR AN ENTITY, ANY CLAIM MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’
			INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
			PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL
			ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL
			WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE
			ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AND
			OneTask AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL
			CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR
			INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. YOU
			AND OneTask FURTHER AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND
			OneTask ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN,
			OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY
			GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A
			PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER.{' '}

			15.2 Notification Procedures and Changes to these Terms

			OneTask may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required
			by Applicable Law or are for marketing or other business related purposes,
			to you via email notice, or written or hard copy notice, or through
			posting of such notice on the Site(s), as determined by OneTask, in its

			not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider
			may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide

			change these Terms in a material manner, we will update the ‘last
			modified’ date at the top of this page and notify you that material
			changes have been made to these Terms. Your continued use of the Service
			after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of

			15.3 Entire Agreement/Severability
		</h5>

		<p>
			These Terms, together with any amendments and any additional agreements
			you may enter into with OneTask in connection with the Service, will
			constitute the entire agreement between you and OneTask concerning the
			Service. Except as otherwise stated in the Arbitration Agreement, if any
			provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent
			jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the
			validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which will remain in
			full force and effect.

		<h5 className='mt-8 text-left font-semibold'>15.4 No Waiver</h5>

		<p>
			No waiver of any term of these Terms will be deemed a further or
			continuing waiver of such term or of any other term, and OneTask’s failure
			to assert any right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a
			waiver of such right or provision.
